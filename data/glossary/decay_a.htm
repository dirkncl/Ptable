		92 protons) becomes an atom of

		<a class="elink" href="..\elements\nucleus.htm">nucleus</a> splits into 
		two daughter <a class="glink" href="nucleus.htm">nuclei</a>. Alpha decay 
		is fundamentally a quantum tunneling process. Unlike beta decay, alpha decay

		<a class="glink" href="nucleus.htm">nuclei</a> are incorporated within a 
		human body. As any heavy <a class="glink" href="atc.htm">charged</a> particle, 
		alpha particles lose their energy within a very short distance in dense 
		media, causing significant damage to surrounding biomolecules. On the other 
		hand, external alpha irradiation is not harmful because alpha particles 
		are completely absorbed by a very thin (micrometers) dead layer of skin 
		as well as by few centimeters of air. However, if a substance radiating 
		alpha particles is injected, ingested or inhaled by an organism it may become 
		a risk, potentially inflicting very serious damage to the organisms&#39; genetic 
		makeup. </td>
