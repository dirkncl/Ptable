            <td class="JF">Elements belonging to <a class="glink" href="group.htm">Group</a> 18 of the <a class="glink" href="pt.htm">periodic table</a>. These <a class="glink" href="element.htm">elements</a> are very unreactive, however, they are not completely nonreactive as <a class="glink" href="compound.htm">compounds</a> containing these elements have been synthesized. Chemically, they are very stable due to having the maximum number of valence
               electrons their outer shell can hold. Valence electrons are the outermost electrons of an atom and are normally the only electrons
               which can participate in chemical bonding. According to atomic theory derived from quantum mechanics and experimental trends,
               <a class="glink" href="atom.htm">atoms</a> with full valence <a class="glink" href="electron.htm">electron</a> shells are extraordinarily stable and therefore do not form chemical bonds. There are no naturally occurring compounds that
               are made up of these elements.

            <td class="JF">All of them exhibit an extremely low chemical reactivity and very few noble gas compounds have been prepared. No conventional
               compounds of <a class="elink" href="..\elements\2.htm">helium</a> or <a class="elink" href="..\elements\10.htm">neon</a> have yet been prepared, while <a class="elink" href="..\elements\54.htm">xenon</a> and <a class="elink" href="..\elements\36.htm">krypton</a> are known to show some reactivity in the laboratory. Recently argon compounds have also been successfully characterised.
               The noble gases' lack of reactivity can be explained in terms of them having a "complete valence shell". They have little
               tendency to gain or lose electrons. The noble gases have high ionization energies and negligible electronegativities. The
               noble gases have very weak inter-atomic forces of attraction, and consequently very low <a class="glink" href="mp.htm">melting points</a> and <a class="glink" href="bp.htm">boiling points</a>. This is why they are all monatomic gases under normal conditions, even those with larger <a class="glink" href="am.htm">atomic masses</a> than many normally solid elements.

            <td class="JF">One of the most commonly encountered uses of the noble gases in everyday life is in lighting. <a class="elink" href="..\elements\18.htm">Argon</a> is often used as a suitable safe and inert atmosphere for the inside of filament light bulbs, and is also used as an inert
               atmosphere in the synthesis of air and moisture sensitive compounds (as an alternative for <a class="elink" href="..\elements\7.htm">nitrogen</a>). Some of the noble gases glow distinctive colours when used inside lighting tubes (<a class="elink" href="..\elements\10.htm">neon</a> lights). <a class="elink" href="..\elements\2.htm">Helium</a>, due to its nonreactivity (compared with flammable <a class="elink" href="..\elements\1.htm">hydrogen</a>) and lightness, is often used in blimps and balloons. <a class="elink" href="..\elements\2.htm">Helium</a> and <a class="elink" href="..\elements\18.htm">Argon</a> are very commonly used to shield a welding arc, and the surrounding base metal from the atmosphere during welding. <a class="elink" href="..\elements\36.htm">Krypton</a> is also used in lasers, which are used by doctors for eye surgery.
