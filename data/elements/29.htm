               of the oldest civilizations on record, and has a history of use that is at least 10,000 years old. A copper pendant was found
               in what is now northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. By 5000 BC, there are signs of copper smelting, the refining of copper
               from simple copper compounds such as malachite or azurite. Among archaeological sites in Anatolia, Catal Hoyuk (~6000 BC)
               features native copper artifacts and smelted <a class="elink" href="82.htm">lead</a> beads, but no smelted copper. But Can Hasan (~5000 BCE) had access to smelted copper; this site has yielded the oldest known
               cast copper artifact, a copper mace head.

            <td class="JF">Copper smelting appears to have been developed independently in several parts of the world. In addition to its development

               is found extensively in the Indus Valley Civilization by the 3rd millennium BC. In Europe, Otzi the Iceman, a well-preserved
               male dated to 3200 BC, was found with a copper-tipped axe whose metal was 99.7% pure. High levels of <a class="elink" href="33.htm">arsenic</a> in his hair suggest he was involved in copper smelting. There are copper and bronze artifacts from Sumerian cities that date
               to 3000 BC, and <a class="slink" href="..\country\EG.htm">Egypt</a>ian artifacts of copper and copper-tin alloys nearly as old. In one pyramid, a copper plumbing system was found that is 5000
               years old. The <a class="slink" href="..\country\EG.htm">Egypt</a>ians found that adding a small amount of <a class="elink" href="50.htm">tin</a> made the metal easier to cast, so bronze alloys were found in <a class="slink" href="..\country\EG.htm">Egypt</a> almost as soon as copper was found. In the Americas production in the Old Copper Complex, located in present day Michigan

               and other metals, and Cyprium because so much of it was mined in Cyprus). From this, the phrase was simplified to cuprum and
               then eventually Anglicized into the English copper. Copper was associated with the goddess Aphrodite/Venus in mythology and
               alchemy, owing to its lustrous beauty, its ancient use in producing mirrors, and its association with Cyprus, which was sacred
               to the goddess. In alchemy the symbol for copper was also the symbol for the planet Venus.
