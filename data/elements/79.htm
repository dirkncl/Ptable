               been used as a symbol for purity, value, royalty, and particularly roles that combine these properties. Gold as a sign of
               wealth and prestige was made fun of by Thomas More in his treatise Utopia. On that imaginary island, gold is so abundant that
               it is used to make chains for slaves, tableware and lavatory-seats. When ambassadors from other countries arrive, dressed
               in ostentatious gold jewels and badges, the Utopians mistake them for menial servants, paying homage instead to the most modestly-dressed
               of their party.
