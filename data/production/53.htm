There are also a few other methods of isolating this element. Although the element is actually quite rare, kelp
               and certain other plants have the ability to concentrate iodine, which helps introduce the element into the food chain as
               well as keeping its cost down.

               Iodine from the mineral is the only economical way to extract the substance.

               reacted with <a class="elink" href="..\elements\17.htm">chlorine</a>. An iodine solution is produced but it is yet too dilute and has to be concentrated. To do this air is blown into the solution
               which causes the iodine to evaporate, then it is passed into an absorbing tower containing acid where sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) is added to reduce the iodine, the solution is then added to <a class="elink" href="..\elements\17.htm">chlorine</a> again to concentrate the solution more, the final solution is the iodine at a level of about 99%.
