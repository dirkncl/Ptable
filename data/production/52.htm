               is less than 0.001 ppm. By comparison, even the rarest of the lanthanoids have crustal abundances of 0.5 ppm, tin and caesium

               than that of <a class="elink" href="..\elements\37.htm">rubidium</a>, even though <a class="elink" href="..\elements\37.htm">rubidium</a> is ten thousand times more abundant in the Earth's crust. Rather, the extraordinarily low abundance of tellurium on Earth
               results from the fact that, during the formation of the Earth, the stable form of elements in the absence of <a class="elink" href="..\elements\8.htm">oxygen</a> and water was controlled by the oxidation and reduction of <a class="elink" href="..\elements\1.htm">hydrogen</a>. Under this scenario elements such as tellurium which form volatile hydrides were severely depleted during the formation
               of the Earth's crust through evaporation. Tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements most depleted in the Earth's crust
               by this process.

It is a component of dusts from blast furnace refining
               of lead. Tellurium is produced mainly in the <a class="slink" href="..\country\US.htm">US</a>, <a class="slink" href="..\country\CA.htm">Canada</a>, <a class="slink" href="..\country\PE.htm">Peru</a>, and <a class="slink" href="..\country\JP.htm">Japan</a>.
