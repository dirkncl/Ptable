            <td>Indium is produced mainly from residues generated during <a class="elink" href="..\elements\30.htm">zinc</a> ore processing but is also found in <a class="elink" href="..\elements\26.htm">iron</a>, <a class="elink" href="..\elements\82.htm">lead</a>, and <a class="elink" href="..\elements\29.htm">copper</a> ores. The amount of indium consumed is largely a function of worldwide LCD production. Increased manufacturing efficiency
               and recycling (especially in Japan) maintain a balance between demand and supply. The average indium price for 2005 was US$900
               per kilogram. This is unusually high. Demand increased as the metal is used in LCDs and televisions, and supply decreased
               when a number of Chinese mining concerns stopped extracting indium from their <a class="elink" href="..\elements\30.htm">zinc</a> tailings. In 2002, the price was US$94/kg.

            <td>Up until 1924, there was only about a gram of isolated indium on the planet. The Earth is estimated to contain about 0.1 ppm
               of indium which means it is about as abundant as <a class="elink" href="..\elements\47.htm">silver</a>, although indium is in fact nearly three times more expensive by weight. <a class="slink" href="..\country\CA.htm">Canada</a> is a leading producer of indium. The TeckCominco refinery in Trail, BC, is the largest single source, with production of
               32,500 kg in 2005, 41,800 kg in 2004 and 36,100 kg in 2003. Worldwide production is typically over 300 tonnes per year, but
               demand has risen rapidly with the increased popularity of LCD computer monitors and televisions.
