               got their name since they were indeed rare as compared to the "common" earths such as lime or magnesia, and historically only
               a few deposits were known.

               Lanthanum is more generally enriched in bastnasite as opposed to monazite, in commercial orebodies. Until 1949, bastnasite
               was a rare and obscure mineral, not even remotely contemplated as a potential commercial source for lanthanoids. In that year,
               the vast deposit at Mountain Pass California was discovered. This discovery alerted geologists as to the existence of a whole
               new class of <a class="glink" href="..\glossary\ree.htm">rare earths</a> deposit, the rare-earth bearing carbonatite, other examples of which soon surfaced, particularly in Africa and <a class="slink" href="..\country\CN.htm">China</a>.
