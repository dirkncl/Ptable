               mass, mercury ores can be extraordinarily concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury
               ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times
               average crustal abundance).
