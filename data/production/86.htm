               radon may accumulate in basements and dwellings. The highest average radon concentrations in counties in the US are found
               in Iowa and in the Appalachian Mountains areas in south-eastern Pennsylvania.

               cladding and into the cooling water, from which it is scavenged. It is then routed to a holdup tank where it remains for a
               large number of <a class="glink" href="..\glossary\hl.htm">half-lives</a>. It is finally purged to the open air through a tall stack which is carefully monitored for radiation level.

               that lowers their action level from 800 to 200 Bq/m<sup>3</sup>. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) strongly recommends action for any house with a concentration higher
               than 148 Bq/m<sup>3</sup> (given as 4 pCi/L), and encourages action starting at 74 Bq/m<sup>3</sup> (given as 2 pCi/L). EPA radon risk level tables including comparisons to other risks encountered in life are available in
               their citizen's guide. Nearly one in 15 homes in the U.S. has a high level of indoor radon according to their statistics.
               The U.S. Surgeon General and EPA recommend all homes be tested for radon. Since 1985, millions of homes have been tested for
               radon in the U.S.
