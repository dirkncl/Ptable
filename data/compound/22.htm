            <TD>Titanium dioxide is the most widely used white pigment because of its brightness and very high refractive index, in which
               it is surpassed only by a few other materials. When deposited as a thin film, its refractive index and colour make it an excellent
               reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors. TiO2 is also an effective opacifier in powder form, where it is employed
               as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, and most
               toothpastes. In cosmetic and skin care products, titanium dioxide is used both as a pigment and a thickener, and in almost
               every sunblock with a physical blocker, titanium dioxide is found both because of its refractive index and its resistance
               to discolouration under ultraviolet light. This advantage enhances its stability and ability to protect the skin from ultraviolet
               light. Titanium dioxide is used as a white food dye. In that use, its E number is E171.

               and corrosion resistance on machine tooling, such as drill bits and milling cutters, often improving their lifetime by a factor
               of three or more.
