            <TD>Alessandro G. A. A. Volta, who invented the voltaic pile "vota pila", was born. He observed the bubbling of methane in swamps
               and in 1776-77 studied the chemistry of gases, discovered methane, and devised experiments such as the ignition of gases by
               an electric spark in a closed vessel. The unit of electric potential, the volt, is named in his honor.
