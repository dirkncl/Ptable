            <TD>William de Wiveleslie Abney was born. He investigated colour photography and colour vision; pioneered a method to measure
               the relative proportions of the primaries in a sample colour; first to take infra-red photographs, and study the solar infra-red
               spectrum; introduced hydroquinone (1880) as an effective photograph developing chemical; measured infra-red spectra of organic
               compounds (1885); studied how sunlight is altered in passing through the atmosphere and invented the abney level.
